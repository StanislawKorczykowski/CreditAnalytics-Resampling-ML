# CreditAnalytics-Resampling-ML

## Overview
This repository contains machine learning models focused on predicting credit card defaults. It employs various resampling techniques to balance the dataset, ensuring more reliable and accurate predictions.

## Features
* Implementation of Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers.
* Application of Grid Search for hyperparameter tuning.
* Use of resampling methods: Random Under-Sampling, Over-Sampling, and SMOTE.
* Evaluation metrics include Accuracy, F1 Score, and ROC AUC.
## Data
The models are trained on a dataset (Credit_card.csv) containing credit card user information and their default status in the following month.

## Requirements
* pandas
* scikit-learn
* imbalanced-learn
* numpy
